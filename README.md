# Java and Spring Boot Running ReactJS

This is a test webapp to initialize a Spring Boot backend and a React frontend. The goal is to have Maven build and run both.

## TODO:
- [x] Create Spring Boot app
- [ ] Add React to the project
- [ ] Use Maven to build the project
- [ ] Make sure hot-reloading works in React out of the box
- [ ] Add Typescript
- [ ] Add styling tools (eslint, tslint, prettier)
